                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I was familiar with using Git and setting up a Github account with the Github Desktop app due to using it for a few game jams and other bigger coding projects. Lately I have been exploring online Git repositories to try out AI image generating plug-ins, such as those based off Stable Diffusion. Given the context of the course considering aspects of the internet and online media, I am struck by the fact that not so long ago such a hugely collaborative forum accessed and supported by an international community would be unthinkable – a wonder in aid of making wonders.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">Speaking of wonders brings to mind reading the Library of Babel by Borges - infinite, orderly chaos that might actually have underlying meaning and an ultimate order repeated…or not. This piece of writing is expressing a feel for a reality symbolistic of our own search for meaning within infinity. This links in for me with the idea of the internet becoming an ever growing reality of its own where we are the delvers, or “librarians,” who plumb the depths for meaning and form conjectures on what else remains to be found or seen. Previously mentioned AI capabilities generate even more similarities with works that iterate upon each other only to become facsimiles of each other – simultaneously with no value while being precious.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">The sentiment of the loss of meaning in the overstimulation of the modern age is reflected in the line "significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential" from Bush’s As We May Think. He addresses not only the constant search for the impactful in amongst the dross of the everyday outpouring of content to consider, but also starts off by considering that some scientists are left searching for something to dedicate themselves to after being part of a greater driving vision during the Second World War where competition was put aside for collaboration towards a common goal. This brings me back to my own thoughts of appreciation for seeing what is possible now with forums such as Github where we can find our own greater campaigns of collaboration during our own quests for meaning in the chaotic landscape of the internet.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">My appreciation of the chaotic wonder of the internet that makes moving acts of collaboration possible drives me as student when faced with the question of what my goals are – I want to learn how to make something that has usefulness and impact that also gets noticed and brings others together in the constant clamour of the internet.</p>

                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-one">Coding Corner:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I have experimented with making games in Twine in the past, so using web development languages, like HTML, has been a very welcome return to my previous explorations. I initially was irritated with the enclosing structure of HTML syntax when I first started out, but I find myself entering more of a flow state now where structured creativity takes place - similar to building a puzzle except you create the pieces from scratch with the reference image changing constantly as you find things that don't work. It scratches a very particular kind of itch.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">Reading Retreat:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I was thinking of Douglas Engelbart's "Augmenting Human Intellect" when I looked through Bruce Lawson's article and video. Accessibility was central to my musings - we are constantly striving to extend our reach as humanity, 'bootstrapping' our way to every greater heights, but what does it really mean if not all of us can access those heights? Are we to be staggered and strung out through different perceived realities, some forced to live in a type of dark age of thought and experience with only a certain type of fortunate individual getting through to the fully realized potential of our efforts? I can only conclude that to combat ever more uneven stratification appearing in our society as the internet and its related technologies surge forth it is essential that we look not only forward to our reaching hand into the future, but take the time to also extend a pulling grip back to keep a better cohesive whole together. We will surely fall together, so it should be that we rise together as well.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-three">Reflective Realm:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">Looking into the history of the internet, one explanation of it's adoption struck me as quite interesting - the integration of it into society and its potential impact can be represented by a sigmoid curve. A slow, drawn-out beginning with a relatively short rise of progression with a relatively sudden stream of acceptance and growth that settles at a new height. I believe that we are already on a similar curve with the advent of AI systems, but this one might not have a settling point that we capable of understanding or appreciating. I think I might be taking this course at the perfect time to gain an excellent, discerning observing lens on what is to come for our world.</p>

                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-one">Website Wonderland:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I have been experimenting with CSS adjustments to get a certain minimalistic look with the aesthetic of "elegant library." It's anything but easy, with more trial and error than I like to employ in designing processes. Also, a key point from my experiences - try to use grid layouts/systems from the get-go! A further added tip is to look into how to structure things with visual hierarchy in mind. The outlines of my early efforts made sense to me, but when presented to family members were not found to be as intuitive as I thought they would be. This pushed me to review them with user-centeredness at the forefront of my mind - I can't claim to have succeeded really, but each iteration gets a little closer to what I want.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">Reflection Revelry:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">Mailloux's paper on Convention & Context was an interesting, coinciding opening into UI and UX considerations for me - there is an intriguing idea that convention itself is a form of acceptance on the part of the user (the coder using a programming language for instance) of the intention-laden, indirect communication by the original designer. It takes a bit of meta-cognition to realize that programming languages themselves, the builders of every online experience, have inherent user interfacing requirements. The lecture added substance to the concept of interaction for me; I was struck by an Alice-In-Wonderland feeling of how strange what we now take as ingrainedly natural truly is - a 'mouse' and 'keyboard of runes' being our points of exchange with a near-mystical, ethereal system.</p>
                <br>  
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-three">Sightless Seer:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I really wonder with each passing day more and more about the innovation we are seeing in near-real-time with AI tools. My own related reading, Michio Kaku's The Future of Humanity, opened the whole concept of that we are beginning to live in a time where people are responsible for making their own future "gods," with only the truly faithful acolytes ascending alongside them to a type of demi-god status. It's as terrifying as it is wondrous.</p>

                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-one">Dawning [Web] Developer:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I started out doing the prescribed JavaScript exercises, but quickly got sidetracked in the best possible way - *"what if I want to try to make A?... Ok, so how do I actually make B more dynamic?..."* By the end of the rabbit hole diving, I had a barebones browser canvas where I would be able to input the dimensions of a rectangle and have it drawn in pixel size on each reload with an outlined text label in it's moving center. I honestly have so much I want to try to implement on my website - primarily I would love a carousel section on the landing page where I can rotate quickly through the other pages of the website in a rolodex overview manner.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">Whirling Wireframes:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">My wireframe was already altered quite a bit from getting other people's reactions (look at the previous blog post), so it weathered this week with not a whole lot changing apart from the logic of the flow - I realized I wasn't providing the user an intuitive next step and had some "dead-ends" in how things would progress with the user potentially jarring to a halt and having to backtrack. I strikes me that we want to *trap* the user into a loop that runs through their consciousness with a light yet impactful footprint.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-three">Diligent Demon or Ambiguous Angel:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">Descartes came up with a thought experiment when he was trying to define his reality with absolute truths - during his "Cogito, ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am) phase - called the Evil Deceiver (Descartes, 1984). The premise is that there is some creature that has power over your perception of reality - able to manipulate your senses and even thoughts. This leads to a hyperbolic doubting of everything we take as true and real - Descartes was left with the end conclusion that the only thing he can claim with surety is that he exists due to the fact that he has some form of thought. Now, something rang an alarm bell in my head when we were discussing interactivity and UI in the lecture this week - "we're in the business of manipulating people" (Geyser, 2023). Given that companies are making advancements with "developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine *interfaces* to connect humans and computers" (Neuralink, 2023) it seems that we're not far from locking ourselves in our own brain vats with our own custom reality-altering creatures - but for now, it's the UI/UX designers that have a head start on understanding and molding reality for humanity. I suppose I prefer to be a benevolent creature than to be its subject.</p>

                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-one">Website Wizardry:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I have been exploring some applications of colour theory while compiling an updated reference/style guide. I really like the combinations of a primarily neon-purple-black palette with cyan accent highlighting, but I worry that it may be a bit too active visually for our purposes - I’m rather sticking for now to a more paper and ink aesthetic unless I find a way to implement the purple-black in a more toned down and elegant manner, which might require me to consider some outline restructuring for visual flow. </p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">IxD - Goals Galore:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I want my website to showcase a sense of technical competence combined with striking creativity. It should be elegant with a bit of bite. It should intrigue the user enough to reach out to me or pursue further details on me at least. </p>
                <br> 
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">IxD - Useful Users:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text"> I want to attract people in both technical and creative industries to look at me as a viable candidate for collaboration purposes. </p>
                <br> 
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">IxD - Compelling Content:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I want to populate my site with coding projects, namely games made by me, and also have some short story pieces with a small gallery of images I’ve edited to my style standard. Again, the point is to showcase stirring creativity with the backing technical proficiency. </p>
                <br>      
                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-three">Practical Perusing:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">While going through the reading, it strikes me how humans like to break things down to understand and thereby begin to influence aspects of our reality. We take a subjective experience of user interaction with various products and try to analyze its moving parts to provide a framework to produce the threads of multiple other similar experiences for other users down the line. A magical blend of intuitive science. </p>
