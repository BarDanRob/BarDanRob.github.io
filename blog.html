                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I was familiar with using Git and setting up a Github account with the Github Desktop app due to using it for a few game jams and other bigger coding projects. Lately I have been exploring online Git repositories to try out AI image generating plug-ins, such as those based off Stable Diffusion. Given the context of the course considering aspects of the internet and online media, I am struck by the fact that not so long ago such a hugely collaborative forum accessed and supported by an international community would be unthinkable – a wonder in aid of making wonders.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">Speaking of wonders brings to mind reading the Library of Babel by Borges - infinite, orderly chaos that might actually have underlying meaning and an ultimate order repeated…or not. This piece of writing is expressing a feel for a reality symbolistic of our own search for meaning within infinity. This links in for me with the idea of the internet becoming an ever growing reality of its own where we are the delvers, or “librarians,” who plumb the depths for meaning and form conjectures on what else remains to be found or seen. Previously mentioned AI capabilities generate even more similarities with works that iterate upon each other only to become facsimiles of each other – simultaneously with no value while being precious.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">The sentiment of the loss of meaning in the overstimulation of the modern age is reflected in the line "significant attainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential" from Bush’s As We May Think. He addresses not only the constant search for the impactful in amongst the dross of the everyday outpouring of content to consider, but also starts off by considering that some scientists are left searching for something to dedicate themselves to after being part of a greater driving vision during the Second World War where competition was put aside for collaboration towards a common goal. This brings me back to my own thoughts of appreciation for seeing what is possible now with forums such as Github where we can find our own greater campaigns of collaboration during our own quests for meaning in the chaotic landscape of the internet.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">My appreciation of the chaotic wonder of the internet that makes moving acts of collaboration possible drives me as student when faced with the question of what my goals are – I want to learn how to make something that has usefulness and impact that also gets noticed and brings others together in the constant clamour of the internet.</p>

                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I have experimented with making games in Twine in the past, so using web development languages, like HTML, has been a very welcome return to my previous explorations. I initially was irritated with the enclosing structure of HTML syntax when I first started out, but I find myself entering more of a flow state now where structured creativity takes place - similar to building a puzzle except you create the pieces from scratch with the reference image changing constantly as you find things that don't work. It scratches a very particular kind of itch.</p>

                <h4 class="main__body-blog-heading-two">Reading Retreat:</h4>
                <p class="main__body-blog-text">I was thinking of Douglas Engelbart's "Augmenting Human Intellect" when I looked through Bruce Lawson's article and video. Accessibility was central to my musings - we are constantly striving to extend our reach as humanity, 'bootstrapping' our way to every greater heights, but what does it really mean if not all of us can access those heights? Are we to be staggered and strung out through different perceived realities, some forced to live in a type of dark age of thought and experience with only a certain type of fortunate individual getting through to the fully realized potential of our efforts? I can only conclude that to combat ever more uneven stratification appearing in our society as the internet and its related technologies surge forth it is essential that we look not only forward to our reaching hand into the future, but take the time to also extend a pulling grip back to keep a better cohesive whole together. We will surely fall together, so it should be that we rise together as well.</p>

A slow, drawn-out beginning with a relatively short rise of progression with a relatively sudden stream of acceptance and growth that settles at a new height. I believe that we are already on a similar curve with the advent of AI systems, but this one might not have a settling point that we capable of understanding or appreciating. I think I might be taking this course at the perfect time to gain an excellent, discerning observing lens on what is to come for our world.</p>
